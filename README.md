# iAttend

[Our Development Website](https://majarman.github.io/iAttendTFL)

## Description
iAttend was designed as a senior project by the Three Furious Locomotives group to be a more efficient means of taking and keeping record of attendance for the music department at the University of Mount Union. The system uses barcodes to identify students, and professors can scan the barcodes to track student attendance for events and recitals. iAttend allows students to receive credit for their attendance and to view their own attendance records. The best part of this productis not only its security, but also its simplicity and ease of use for those who are technologically apprehensive.

## Features
### User Interfaces
iAttend features the following user interfaces:
- A mobile app that consists of a barcode scanner and settings to select the correct course
- A website that consists of tables displaying student attendance and the ability for professors to edit their courses and the student attendance for each course

The mobile and web interfaces work together to provide a quick and easy method for department chairs and professors to create a course, set its rules and the course roster, and alter attendance records.

### Back End
iAttend consists of the following back end components:
- A PostgreSQL database containing tables for the users, classes, and attendance records
- Web services that act as a middleman between the users and the database

## Additional Information
See SRS-ThreeFuriousLocomotives.pdf for complete details on the program requirements.
