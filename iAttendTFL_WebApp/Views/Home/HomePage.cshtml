    <p>Welcome to your iAttend homepage!</p>
    <br />
    <p>iAttend is a software system created for the Music Department of the University of Mount Union.</p>
    <p>
        This system is designed to track and report attendance for recital credits. After the easy account creation and setup process, 
        all the admin and professor roles have to do is scan barcodes of the student users to record attendance. It should be similar to 
        scanning goods at a self-checkout at a grocery store. Security and ease-of-use have been the greatest priorities throughout the 
        development of this system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The iAttend system was created for the Music Department of the University of Mount Union by the Three Furious Locomotives (TFL). 
        TFL is a team comprised of Alec Barker, Matthew Dutt, and Michael Jarman, and is associated with the Spring 2020 CSC 492 senior software 
        engineering course at the University of Mount Union.
