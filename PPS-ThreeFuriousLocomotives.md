## Introduction

iAttend will serve as a more efficient means of recording attendance for the Music department at the University of Mount Union. The system will use QR codes to identify students and to scan and track their attendance to events for recital credits. The iAttend system will consist of three main components: the database, the web service, and the mobile application. The three components will work seamlessly to provide a quick and easy method for the department chair/professor to create a course, its rules and roster, and administer attendance. It will allow students to receive credit for their attendance and to view their progress. Beneficial features of this product will include its security, as well as its simplicity and ease of use for those who may be technologically apprehensive.
